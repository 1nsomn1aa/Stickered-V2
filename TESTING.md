## Bugs

| Bug | Description | Solution | Fixed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default profile picture gets deleted after user uploads a new image | In order to save space, I made the old user profile picture delete if a new picture has been uploaded | Exclude "default.jpg" from being marked as an old profile picture | Yes |
| Cart page would throw error 500 on deployed version | Cart was working great on my local version, but would show error 500 on the deployed heroku site | Include "load static" tag | Yes |
| Website not loading any images from AWS S3 | I was using my previously used method of writing each piece of AWS access information line-by-line at the bottom of the settings.py file which caused issues, since the "STORAGES" section at the top was still using the default backend information | Delete AWS "line-by-line information and use it in the "STORAGES" section instead | Yes |
| Newsletter form wouldn't send confirmation emails | When creating the newsletter form I forgot to register the form in my views which caused the newsletter form not work | Register the newsletter form in the views.py | Yes |
| Forms not loading in deployed site | I did not include CSRF tokens with my forms, which wasn't an issue in my local version with DEBUG set to TRUE, but was a problem in the deployed version | Add CSRF tokens to forms | Yes |
| JS scripts not loading in deployed version | I hardcoded static links initially, which didn't work after moving static files to AWS | Replace hardcoded filepaths with {% static 'url' %} links | Yes |
| Stripe webhooks failing to find the PaymentIntent | The url I provided to the Stripe webhook crawler was incorrect | Provide Stripe webhooks a correct link to my checkout | Yes |

To my knowledge, there are currently no remaining bugs on the website.
